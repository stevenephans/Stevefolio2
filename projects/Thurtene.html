            is a strange but enduring philanthropic tradition at WashU. Students form into 6 massive
            teams and compete to build the best themed carnival facade/theater. The carnival is a
            popular weekend for the community and alumni. WashU grads and St. Louisans alike flock
            to the event to watch the performances and donate to their favorite facade. Proceeds go
            to each group's partner charity of choice.

            <br />
            While my involvement with ThurtenE spanned my entire college career, I served as our
            group's project director during my last year. The job was equal parts project
            management, architectural design, and construction workhorse. I managed 200 volunteers
            in all design and construction tasks for the 1000+ man-hour project over the course of 6
            months.
            <br />
            <br />
            Our theme was 'City Block'. We built the outside to resemble urban store fronts while
            the inside imitated a subway station. The facade was a hit and we were awarded first
            place overall!
