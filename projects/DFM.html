            DFM covered an immense amount of material - manufacturing proccesses strengths & limitations/design strategies/relative costs, 
            engineering material selection, and how to navigate all these options to optimize a part/assembly of parts' functionality and 
            price point.  We covered GD&T and how to create fully-dimensioned, readable drawings.  It was hands down one of the most 
            information-dense courses I've ever taken.  
            <br />
            <br />
            The course deliverables were two comprehensive engineering design reports. For the first, each group selected an existing 
            product with 15+ parts and reverse-engineered it completely: model all components, draft manufacturing drawings, fully evaluate
            the production process (manufacturing methods, material choices, product assembly), and finally provide 3 DFMA improvements to 
            reduce cost without sacrificing product functionality. The second report required similar analysis, but concerned
            a novel product design developed by the group.

              Design Thinking is a human-centered approach to product
              development. Before any ideation took place, we needed to
              understand our user's point-of-view. Why don't they always pick up
              after their pets? What's the worst bit about the clean-up process?
              We interviewed numerous dog owners in the Boulder area, listening
              to their views on the issue and looking for hidden insights and
              common themes.

              With these broad-stroke needs of our users in mind, our team began
              brainstorming every possible solution we could imagine. We charted
              these ideas in the concept map below.
