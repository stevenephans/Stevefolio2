            <br />
            We chose dog poop....more specifically, pet waste left uncleaned in public spaces. It's
            an unpleasant addition to the community and an underratedly insidious detriment to the
            environment.

            <h1>Phase 1: The Root of the Problem</h1>
            <p>
              Design Thinking is a human-centered approach to product development. Before any
              ideation took place, we needed to understand our user's point-of-view. Why don't they
              always pick up after their pets? What's the worst bit about the clean-up process? We
              interviewed numerous dog owners in the Boulder area, listening to their views on the
              issue and looking for hidden insights and common themes.
              <br />
              <br/>
            </p>

            <iframe width="704" height="396" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IvHdLyO4itM">
            </iframe>
            <p>
              <br />
              We extracted two main, addressable points from these initial interviews:
              <br />1) If there's a trashcan nearby, clean-up is no big deal. But having to carry a
              loaded bag around indefinitely is awful.
              <br />
              2) Dog waste is no fun to handle or smell (big surprise there!). The less direct
              contact, the better.
              <br />
              <br />
            </p>

            <p>
              We drafted the following 'need statement' from our observations:
              <br />
              <strong>
                Dog owners need an easy, reliable, and comfortable way to deal with dog waste until
                they can dispose of it properly.
              </strong>
            </p>

          <div class="projinfo">
            <h1 style="margin-top:20px">Phase 2: 'Pretotype' Development</h1>
            <p>
              With these broad-stroke needs of our users in mind, our team began brainstorming every
              possible solution we could imagine. We charted these ideas in the concept map below.
              <br />
            </p>
            <img src="../images/APD_ConceptMap.png" style="width:75%; align-self:center" />
            <p>
              After reviewing our ideas, we felt a portable receptacle, optimized for ease of use
              and robust waste containment, would best address our user's needs. We synthesized our
              ideas into three unique 'pretotype' designs for the first round of user testing: a
              rigid bodied container designed to serve as a leash handle replacement, a flexible
              container with a multipurpose clip for storage/attachment, and a variable size
              waterproof roll-top bag.
              <br />
              <br />
              <span
                ><a

                ></span
              >
              are a sort of quick and dirty prototype. They are intentionally low-fidelity, as their
              primary purpose is to embody the fundamental characteristics of an idea; they help
              determine if users think an idea is worthy of further pursuit.
              <br />
              <br />

              <br />
              We were happy to find that all our users interviewed found the idea of a dedicated,
              on-the-go waste container very appealing! Observing them interact with the pretotypes,
              and listening to their thoughts, we established desired features for the next stage of
              development.
              <br />
              <br />
              Users wanted a rigid bodied container with sufficient space for 2-3 waste bags, but
              not so large as to impinge on convenient portability. Ideally the lid could be
              operated with a single hand and would stay reliably sealed. Many users liked the
              'leash handle' attachment idea, but pointed out that it was not a viable option for
              all leash styles. We decided if it could be included, great, but a design that fit in
              a backpack (human or dog) with a multipurpose attachment point would provide a more
              universally appealing solution.

          <div class="projinfo">
            <h1 style="margin-top:20px">Phase 3: Initial Prototypes</h1>
            <p>
              Our first round of prototypes addressed the needs gleaned from the pretotype studies
              while further optimizing for ease of use. We fabricated a lid mechanism designed for
              one-handed operation, two unique main-body models to evaluate ergonomics as well as
              waste capacity and device stowability, and finally a novel bag securement technology
              that would allow for speedy and convenient storage and removal of filled waste bags.
              <br />
              <br />

              The lid prototype was well received during user testing. It functioned smoothly and
              reliably with only one hand and remained sealed when dropped from heights of up to
              6ft.
              <br />
              <br />

              <br />
              <br />
              Both main-body prototypes felt good in hand and fit nicely in all the backpacks we
              tried. Each featured a flared mouth for easy bag placement which tapered down to a
              slightly reduced diameter (2.5in and 3.5in). User's agreed the smaller of the two
              didn't provide adequate room for effortless waste bag input, so we opted for the
              larger option moving forward.
              <br />
              <br />

              <br />
              During pretotype testing, we observed users still had to knot the bags before they
              could safely store them. Tying knots is an unfortunately two-handed endeavor, and
              having to do so undermined our ability to create a purely one-handed waste management
              experience. Determined to solve the issue, we developed a system of rubber-lined
              notches. These 'No-Knot-Notches' effectively sealed and secured the used bags,
              eliminating the need for knot tying! The exposed bag end also provided a convenient
              access point when removing bags from the container. Users were thrilled with the
              innovation!

              After a semester of user research, testing, and development, we synthesized all we
              learned into a 'final prototype' for extended user testing. Our lucky chosen user,
              Ben, took it to the streets and ran it through the gauntlet of real-world, day-to-day
              use.

              Due to budget and time constraints, we were unable to fully realize our 'dream design'
              for the GoPail. With additional resources we hope to refine the industrial design,
              integrate a bag dispenser & LED, experiment with attachment clip styles, further
              develop the No-Knot-Notch system (you'll notice the final prototype's notches are a
              pared down version of the initial prototype), add a 'safety' mechanism for opening the
              lid, and scale the design into two or three discrete sizes for owners with small,
              medium, or large dogs. A conceptual 2nd generation design I drew is pictured below.
