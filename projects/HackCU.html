        <p id="about">
          In February of 2020, some friends and I participated in CU Boulder's bi-annual hackathon
          put on by Major League Hacking. Hack CU was my first ever hackathon, and seeing as I had never
          programmed a line of code in my life as of August 2019 I was both nervous and excited to see how I could
          help my team (who are all Computer Science Master's students). The contest was completely open ended, but each
          event sponsor had a challenge for teams to pursue. We opted to compete in
          Twitter's
          (best use of the Twitter API) and Adobe's (best use of Adobe XD). After an hour or two of brainstorming, we
          decided to build a webgame inspired by <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wiki_Game"
              target="_blank" class="inlineLink">Wikirace</a></span>, except in ours you would have to navigate from a
          start to an end hashtag solely using other hashtags
          in the available tweets. We dubbed it <span><a href="https://devpost.com/software/twitter-hashtag-race"
              target="_blank" class="inlineLink">'#HASHTAGRACE'.</a></span>
          </br>
          </br>
          Besides helping develop the idea, I designed the UX with Adobe Xd and coded the entire front-end. As the team
          finished pieces of the back-end, I supported its integration into my code. 23.5 hours after starting we had a
          working prototype with two modes: you could try and link the chosen hashtags manually, or you could let 'Bob
          the Bot' try and find a connection. He often did, it was often hilarious, and it was often not PG. Twitter can
          be a dark place...
          <br />
          <br />
          While Twitter's judges didn't love Bob's creative connections, the Adobe Team was thrilled with
          our use of XD. We were the only group to build our UX design into a working website. They awarded us a free
          year-long subscription to Creative Cloud for the project. Our group's entry also won 'Most Random' in the
          overall competition.
          </br>
          </br>
          <strong>Unfortunately, Twitter has since implemented some serious adjustments to their API which broke the
            #HashtagRace's back-end. At some point we hope to sit down as a team and re-work the code to get it up and
            running again.

            <p class="caption">Our user-side Adobe Xd mock-up. As you make choices, the most common neighbor hashtags
              auto-populate the screen. Click count is tracked in the bottom left so you can compare your performance
              against Bob the Bot. If and when you successfully link from start to end, the UI pulls and displays the
              Tweets used. All hashtags used in the UI mock-up are completely made-up visual placeholders...in case that
              was not obvious.</p>
