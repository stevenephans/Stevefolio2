          <p id="about">
            In February of 2020, some friends and I participated in CU Boulder's bi-annual hackathon, 
            <span
            ><a href="https://hackcu.org/" target="_blank" class="inlineLink"
              >HackCU</a
            ></span>, put on by Major League Hacking. Hack CU was my first ever hackathon, and seeing as I had never 
            programmed a line of code in my life as of that August I was both nervous and excited to see how I could 
            help my team (who are all Computer Science Masters students).
          </br>
          </br>
          The contest had no rules or limitations - any team could code any project they imagined.  However, there 
          were numerous event sponsors with challenges they encouraged groups to pursue. We opted to compete in Twitter's 
          (best use of the Twitter API) and Adobe's (best use of Adobe XD). After an hour or two of brainstorming, we 
          decided to build a webgame inspired by <span
          ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wiki_Game" target="_blank" class="inlineLink"
            >Wikirace</a
          ></span>, except in ours you would have to navigate from a start to an end hashtag solely using other hashtags 
          in the available tweets. We dubbed it '#THERACE'.
        </br>
        </br>
          Besides helping develop the idea, I designed the site's UX with Adobe XD and coded the entire front-end. As the 
          team finished pieces of the back-end, I supported its integration into my code. 23.5 hours after starting we had
          a working prototype with two modes: you could try and link the chosen hashtags manually, or you could let 'Bob the Bot'
          try and find a connection. He often did, it was often hilarious, and it was often not PG. Twitter can be a dark place...
        </br>
      </br>
          While Twitter's judges didn't love Bob's creative connections, the Adobe Team was thrilled with our use of XD. We 
          were the only group to build our UX design into a working website. They awarded us a free year-long subscription to 
          Creative Cloud for the project. Our group's entry also won 'Most Random' in the overall competition.
