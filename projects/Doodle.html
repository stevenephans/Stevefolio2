          <p id="about">
            My undergraduate education solidified my interest in product design engineering and inspired me to undertake one of the most valuable experiences 
            of my professional life.  Armed with our engineering degrees and a cache of ideas, my good friend and I co-founded our own 
            product development company, Doodle Design LLC. While running Doodle, we successfully launch two distinct products: 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Hat Flaps â€“ an amusing earmuff accessory for baseball caps.
            <br/>
            Dog Hearts - a uniquely animated iPhone app for the card game Hearts
            <br/>
            <br/>
            It was a veritable crash course in the realities of taking a polished product to market.  Every day presented 
            a new challenge to conquer, largely outside of the actual engineering process.  We negotiated with manufacturers, pitched to corporate buyers, and 
            re-worked advertising strategies to best serve our identified user market. Although Doodle closed doors after a year of operation, the entrepreneurial 
            adventure was a tremendous learning experience.
