        <p id="about">
          My undergraduate education solidified my interest in product design engineering and inspired me to undertake
          one of the most valuable experiences of my professional life. Armed with our engineering degrees and a cache
          of ideas, my good friend and I co-founded our own product development company, Doodle Design LLC. While
          running Doodle, we successfully launch two distinct products:
          <br />
          <br />
          Hat Flaps â€“ an amusing earmuff accessory for baseball caps.
          <br />
          Dog Hearts - a uniquely animated iPhone app for the card game Hearts
          <br />
          <br />
          It was a veritable crash course in the realities of taking a polished product to market. Every day presented a
          new challenge to conquer, largely outside of the actual engineering process. We negotiated with manufacturers,
          pitched to corporate buyers, and re-worked advertising strategies to best serve our identified user market.
          Although Doodle closed doors after a year of operation, the entrepreneurial adventure was a tremendous
          learning experience.
