            DFM covered an immense amount of material - manufacturing proccesses strengths & limitations/design strategies/relative costs, 
            engineering material selection, and how to navigate all these options to optimize a part/assembly of parts' functionality and 
            price point.  We covered GD&T and how to create fully-dimensioned, readable drawings.  It was hands down one of the most 
            information-dense courses I've ever taken.  
            <br />
            <br />
            The course deliverables consisted of two immense project design reports. For the first, each group had to selected an existing 
            product with 15+ parts and reverse-engineer it completely: model all components, create fully dimensioned drawings, evaluate 
            each one's manufacturing method/material choice with included cost estimations, and finally provide 3 DFMA improvements to 
            reduce the product's cost without sacrificing functionality. The second report had similar requirements to the reverse 
            engineering report, except each group had to develop a novel product in this case (total part count was flexible, and there were no DFMA 
            improvements to make).

              Design Thinking is a human-centered approach to product
              development. Before any ideation took place, we needed to
              understand our user's point-of-view. Why don't they always pick up
              after their pets? What's the worst bit about the clean-up process?
              We interviewed numerous dog owners in the Boulder area, listening
              to their views on the issue and looking for hidden insights and
              common themes.
