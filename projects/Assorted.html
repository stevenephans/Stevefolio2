        None of the following mini-projects quite deserve a dedicated page on their own, but I'm proud of the
        work and
        creativity each one involved. Together they make up a veritable pot-pourri of engineering, product design, and
        art.
        Enjoy!

      + 'resources there, so I designed and built this simple orthopaedic screwdriver. The torque limiting feature works using a simple ball detente and compression spring. Besides the spring and driver bit, I designed and fabricated all of the components.',

      'I studied abroad the first semester of my junior year at Wash U, and only had 3 weeks of break sophomore summer before leaving for Australia. Excited for my upcoming travels, I decided I wanted one of those "pin" maps to record all the places I had been. <br/><br/>Turns out huge map posters are not cheap, so I decided to make my own during the abridged summer break. I scrounged my garage for materials, found a pad of watercolor paper, and pieced together the sheets into a wall-map-sized canvas. After that, all it took was 100+ hours of meticulous drawing and painting of every land mass on the planet. Voila. Free "pin" map.',
      '',
      'Considering it only cost $25, I got a terrific deal on my bike at the Boulder GoodWill. It was in great shape mechanically, but the paint job was concerningly rusty. With my excess bike budget, I decided to give give it a much needed facelift.',
      'I machined these parts for my machine shop coursework at De Anza. <br/><br/>Top Right: Eccentrical Cylinder & Mounting Plate. These were the final 2 projects in the "Advanced Manual Machining" class. They required mill and lathe operations, and all tolerances were tighter than +/- 0.003". We inspected the parts on the probe CMM to confirm they met all specs. <br/><br/>The remaining three pieces were CNC machined in my "Intro to Numerical Control" class. I wrote the G-Code programs entirely by hand.',
      'Before the era of in-car phone mounts arrived, I built myself a simple rig so I could conveniently watch YouTube while driving! (Just kidding - I used it to display map directions)',
      'Again using the resources at De Anza, I modeled and 3D printed a custom 1.5" clipper guard. At the time I was tirelessly practicing my SolidWorks skills, and this was a fun little reverse-engineering project to test measurement and model accuracy. <br/><br>The end result snapped onto my clippers snugly and securely. That being said, it did not work so well...there is clearly a reason no one makes guards larger than 1". My hair just flopped out of the way under the blade pressure at that height. It worked great if I gelled my hair straight up though! Unfortunately I did not get any photographic evidence from that experiment.',
      'After a couple years of being sat on regularly, my wallet is not as pretty as it once was. Aesthetics aside, the design functionality came out great and works as well as it ever did.',
      '<span><a href="https://www.potaito.com/" target="_blank" class="inlineLink">My friend Tait is a wildly talented woodworker</a></span>, and coincidentally a longboard builder as well. For a time, he ran a company selling his artisan board builds - \'Potaito Boards\'. I told him there was an OBVIOUS opportunity to get double the mileage out of the pun if he sold cutting boards too, but he never did. Real shame. At least he let me borrow the company brand to make my own Potaito Boards chopping block.',
      'This was my completed "natural patterns" assignment for my Architectural Design minor at Wash U. We had to develop two modular units, one wood and one wire, based off patterns we observed at Forest Park. I abstracted the roots (wood) and bark (wire) from a particularly old, twisted tree.',
      'Every year my friends and I get together for a casual disc golf tournament at Lake Tahoe. As the only attendee with any artistic inclination whatsoever, I get to design the official competition disc. Lake Tahoe has a sanctioned tournament called "King of the Lake" - which none of us are anywhere close to good enough for - so we dubbed our tourney "Prince of the Pond".'];
