        <p id="about">
          When my friends asked me to once again join their Hack CU team I
          readily accepted. With fully remote operation, the 2021 hackathon
          didn't attract as many participants or sponsors, but there were
          still some exciting challenges and prizes on the table. We opted to
          compete for 'Best UI/UX' with our project -
          <span><a href="https://devpost.com/software/launch-party" target="_blank"
              class="inlineLink">LaunchParty.</a></span>
          <br />
          <br />
          Launch Party is a dedicated platform for music fans to digitally
          commune and listen to new album drops for the first time together.
          The application's lets fans react positively/negatively to songs in
          real time as they are listening and rate each song as well as the
          album as a whole based-off their first impressions. After completing
          the first listen, they then can access a dedicated page to discuss
          the album in general, individual songs, and view aggregate stats
          with everyone else who has listened.
          <br />
          <br />
          Similar to the first hackathon, my teammates handled all back-end
          programming and I handled the front-end code, UI, and UX. It was an
          exhausting 24 hours, but we delivered an impressively complete MVP
          and won the 'Best UI/UX' contest!
        </p>

            </div>
            <p class="caption">Here is our final deliverable after 24 long hours of work. The MVP pulls all song
              information from the linked account in real time using the Spotify API. The waveform visualization color
              reflects the user's reaction clicks - minty green for positive feedback and grey for negative. On the
              back end, all of the reaction information is time-stamped and stored in a database to eventually be
              translated into song specific infographics. Finally, when the song approaches completion, the MVP prompts
              you to rate the song.</p>

            <p>We built the MVP's front-end using the two interface protoypes above as reference. The Xd mock-up on
              the left
              provides a more complete view of the UI/UX flow, including a bare bones example of what the post-listen
              album stats page might look like. While the MVP is more polished than the JavaScript prototype on the
              right in almost every way, the prototype shows the reaction depletion feature in action. We wanted users
              to react thoughtfully rather than just spam the buttons out of control (which inevitably some people would
              do), so we opted for a finite amount per song. Each button's background fill displays the amount
              remaining, and the button is disabled once fully depleted.</p>
