        <p id="about">
          During the Summer of 2014, I worked on a interdisciplinary team of engineers, surgeons, and computer
          scientists to develop an orignal mesh material for hernia repair surgeries which more naturally replicated
          abdominal tissue material properties. I was primarily responsible for designing and building experimental
          setups critical to research data acquisition. Using fluoroscopic imaging, we tracked in-vivo movement of
          metallic tissue markers. Then using Direct Linear Transformation algorithms, we calculated distance and backed
          out material property estimates. The equipment I built served as a 3D cartesian grid which we used as a fixed
          frame of reference. We were a small team, and besides experimental setup design, I supported the work however
          I could by helping with data analysis, MATLAB scripting, and more.
