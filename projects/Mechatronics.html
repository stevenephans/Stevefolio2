        <p id="about">
          Mechatronics revolved around designing a simple robot to execute a series of tasks determined by the class.
          We came up with a 'police academy' training course. The robot must autonomously navigate the course, identify
          criminals from bystanders
          (read: red construction paper people from green ones), and knock them over with a physical projectile. The
          work was entirely hands-on.
          I spent hours wiring circuits to microcontrollers, examining component datasheets, scripting in arduino, and
          troubleshooting any hardware or software issues that arose.
          <br />
          <br />
          And then there was COVID. The abrupt and complete campus closure drastically changed the nature of class and
          overall feasibility of the project.
          Nearly all groups disbanded, opting for one of the impromptu, hands-off alternatives offered. Thankfully, the
          professor and I worked out a solution for
          any groups who wanted to continue: turn my one-bedroom apartment into an off-campus robotics lab. Given the
          vastly diminished resource access, expectations were lowered.
          In the end, we completed and proofed all subsystems (navigation, target ID, and projectile), but could not
          perform an integrated test due to resource limitations.
          But we made the best of a lousy situation without completely losing out on one of the most enriching courses
          I've ever taken.
