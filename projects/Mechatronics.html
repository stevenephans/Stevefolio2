          CU Boulder's Mechatronics course revolved around designing a simple robot to execute a series of tasks
          determined by the class.
          We came up with a 'police academy' training course. The robot must autonomously navigate the course, identify
          criminals from bystanders
          (read: red construction paper people from green ones), and knock them over with a physical projectile. The
          work was entirely hands-on.
          I spent hours wiring circuits to microcontrollers, examining component datasheets, scripting in arduino, and
          troubleshooting any hardware or software issues that arose.
          <br />
          <br />
          And then there was COVID. The abrupt and complete campus closure drastically changed the nature of class and
          overall feasibility of the project.
          Nearly all groups disbanded, opting for one of the impromptu, hands-off alternatives offered. Thankfully, the
          professor and I worked out a solution for
          any groups who wanted to continue: turn my one-bedroom apartment into an off-campus robotics lab. Given the
          vastly diminished resource access, expectations were lowered.
          In the end, we completed and proofed all subsystems (navigation, target ID, and projectile), but could not
          perform an integrated test due to resource limitations.
          But we made the best of a lousy situation without completely losing out on one of the most enriching courses
          I've ever taken.

            </a></span>
          Industrial Automation course taught practical implementation of classical signal processing
          and feedback control theory through project-based lab work.
          We learned analog to digital signal conversion, digital to analog signal reconstruction, system
          identification and modeling, and experimented implementing
          these techniques using a Single-Input-Single-Ouput device, the
          <span><a href="https://www.tangiblesthatteach.com/product-page/t-recs-system" class="inlineLink"
              target="_blank">T-RECS System.
            </a></span>
          The stock product used an Arduino Nano and potentiometer sensor, but we modified the base design to include an
          encoder, accelerometer, and Arduino Due.
          <br />
          <br />
          This advanced functionality allowed us to compare sensor performace, implement system feedback
          control, and dive deeper into the world of digital
          signal processing overall. The hands-on coursework involved significant microcontroller programming,
          MATLAB scripting, component datasheet investigation,
          and experimental design. Dr. Ruben is a terrific professor, and his class greatly expanded my
          knowledge of signal processing, programming, and circuitry design.

          </a></span>
          class on the application of non-rigid materials in robotics and
          electronics was equal parts informative and inspiring. The
          pot-pourri of topics included polymer chemistry,
          dialectrics, passive energy generation, and everything
          inbetween. I learned a great deal about the current
          challenges facing robotics today, and how the burgeoning
          field of soft machines might solve them. As part of the
          course, Dr. Keplinger gave us access to his lab to build two
          simple soft actuators: the
          <span><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6371/61/tab-figures-data" class="inlineLink"

          and

              target="_blank">DEA.
            </a></span>
          Each group had to document the fabrication process with an 'entertaining' video (above).
          </br>
          </br>
          For the final project, groups composed
          a research paper on a soft robotics topic of their choosing.
          Beyond explaining the topic and reporting on
          current research areas, we composed a research
          proposal of our own for the technology. My group
          chose

              target="_blank">McKibben Muscles.
            </a></span>
          Our research proposal investigated the potential for
          asymmetric braid patterns to generate curved actuation paths.
          According to Dr. Keplinger: "[He] would fund that."
