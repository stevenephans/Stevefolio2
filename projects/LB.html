          I started longboarding in the 6th grade - around the same time my dad granted me supervision-free access to
          his rudimentary garage wood shop.
          Skating quickly became my go-to after school activity, and it wasn't long before I stared building boards
          myself.
          <br />
          <br />
          Longboard building was my
          unofficial introduction to engineering and product development. Over the course of 5 or so years, my process
          evolved from basic plywood cutouts, to laminated
          composite decks pressed into curved profiles. I started ordering single-ply hardwood sheets in bulk from
          Canadian sawmills so I could customize layer-to-layer grain alignment,
          and rolls of tri-axial fiberglass cloth to reduce deck thickness while improving strength and flexibility. At
          its peak, pretty much every penny I earned working at the neighborhood
          pizza parlor went to board building R&D. I never actually bought a board after my very first one...so I guess
          I was saving some money in that respect?

      'After band sawing and varnishing a few oval shaped slabs of 3/4" plywood I knew I needed to upgrade my manufacturing infrastructure, so I designed a press with an interchangeable rib system. Despite largely being made out of scrap I found in the garage, the press worked brilliantly.',
      'Interchangeable rib modules allowed me to adjust the longitudinal camber/rocker profile of each deck. Transverse concave was built into ribs, so I made three separate sets - one for light, mild, and aggressive concave.',

      'Maple & fiberglass composite board with hand-cut griptape',
      'Canadian maple shortboard (sized to fit in my suitcase) with hand-cut griptape. I hurriedly slapped this board together before my semester abroad in Australia, but I now consider it to be my my very best deck design. It\'s portable, responsive, and stable enough for some casual downhill riding. This has been my go-to board since 2012.',
      'My most recent board build (circa 2015) molded in a vacuum press on a foam form. It\'s both horizontally and vertically laminated. First I made 2 striped plys by vertically laminating red/white oak strips, which I then pressed together horizontally with fiberglass inbetween. The minimalist graphic was laser-engraved.',
