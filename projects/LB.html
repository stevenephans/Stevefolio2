        <p id="about">
          I started longboarding in the 6th grade - around the same time my dad granted me supervision-free access to
          his rudimentary garage wood shop.
          Skating quickly became my go-to after school activity, and it wasn't long before I stared building boards
          myself.
          <br />
          <br />
          Longboard building was my
          unofficial introduction to engineering and product development. Over the course of 5 or so years, my process
          evolved from basic plywood cutouts, to laminated
          composite decks pressed into curved profiles. I started ordering single-ply hardwood sheets in bulk from
          Canadian sawmills so I could customize layer-to-layer grain alignment,
          and rolls of tri-axial fiberglass cloth to reduce deck thickness while improving strength and flexibility. At
          its peak, pretty much every penny I earned working at the neighborhood
          pizza parlor went to board building R&D. I never actually bought a board after my very first one...so I guess
          I was saving some money in that respect?
          <br />
          <br />
          After band sawing and varnishing a few oval shaped slabs of 3/4" plywood I knew I needed to upgrade my
          manufacturing infrastructure,
          so I designed a press with an interchangeable rib system. Despite largely being made out of scrap I found in
          the garage, the press
          worked brilliantly.
