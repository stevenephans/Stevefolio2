            I started longboarding in the 6th grade - around the same time my dad granted me supervision-free access to his rudimentary garage wood shop. 
            Skating quickly became my go-to after school activity, and it wasn't long before I stared building boards myself. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Longboard building was my 
            unofficial introduction to engineering and product development. Over the course of 5 or so years, my process evolved from basic plywood cutouts, to laminated 
            composite decks pressed into curved profiles. I started ordering single-ply hardwood sheets in bulk from Canadian sawmills so I could customize layer-to-layer grain alignment, 
            and rolls of tri-axial fiberglass cloth to reduce deck thickness while improving strength and flexibility. At its peak, pretty much every penny I earned working at the neighborhood 
            pizza parlor went to board building R&D. I never actually bought a board after my very first one...so I guess I was saving some money in that respect?
            <br/>
            <br/>
            After band sawing and varnishing a few oval shaped slabs of 3/4" plywood I knew I needed to upgrade my manufacturing infrastructure, 
            so I designed a press with an interchangeable rib system. Despite largely being made out of scrap I found in the garage, the press 
            worked brilliantly.
