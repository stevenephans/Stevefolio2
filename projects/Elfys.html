          <p id="about">
            Elfy's Inc specialized in quick-turn injection molded prototypes. Our clients ranged from the veteran engineer with a career's 
            worth of design experience to retirees who knew little to nothing about injection molding, but needed help turning their 3D printed idea 
            into a mass-produceable product. During my 2 years of work, I became deeply familiar with injection molded part design requirements and material options. 
            I helped realize designs for medical devices, toys, electronic housings, and a host of other consumer products.
            <br />
            <br />
            As the sole manufacturing engineer, I wore many hats - mold design, mold fabrication, and part dimensional validation were my primary responsibilites outside of design consultation. 
            But with such a small team, we all worked together to accomplish whatever was needed. I helped our process technician with molding machine repairs, 
            delivered completed parts to clients occasionally, built a website for the company, and sorted out more IT problems than I ever thought I would.

            As an aspiring product design engineer, it was an invaluable learning experience. The photos below comprise a small sample of the work we did.
